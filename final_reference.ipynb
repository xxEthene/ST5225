    "The solution to each problem is to be stored in the dictionary variable `ans`: Your answer to Problem 1 should be stored in `ans[1]`, your answer to Problem 2 should be stored in `ans[2]`, and so forth. If you do the coding in a separate place and only store the results in this notebook, you will not get any partial points in case your answer is wrong, so I encourage you to add the full code to this notebook. **Make sure the whole Jupyter Notebook runs without errors before submitting**. You can check this by pressing _Run All_ in the menu.\n",

    "For each problem, the number of points you can achieve is indicated in the question. **The maximum number of points is 20**. Points are only given if the code runs error-free and the output is correct. Partial points may be given depending on the quality of the answer. It is also indicated whether you should use Python or R to solve the problem.\n",

    "[**4 points** (one point each), **R**]. Use the function `ergmm` (**set `seed=42` as argument to the function**) from the `latentnet` R-library to fit a latent space model to the graph `G2` with (1) an edge term (2) a term representing the absolute difference between the ages of the nodes, (3) a term that reflects whether two nodes have the same gender (4) a two dimensional latent space term with Euclidean distance. For the latent space term, fit the model with 1, 2, and 3 groups, respectively. Save the BIC of the model with 1, 2, and 3 groups in `ans_13`, `ans_14`, and `ans_15`, respectively. Then, use the BIC as selection criterion and store the best model number in `ans_16`, that is, store the number 1, 2 or 3. _Please note that the variable name is different from the previous problems. It will be exported to Python and stored in `ans` automatically._ _Note: Do not worry about convergence or other MCMC warnings for the purpose of this exam._\n"
